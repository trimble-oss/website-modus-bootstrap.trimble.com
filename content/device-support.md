Trimble suite of products spans a plethora of sectors and devices. In order to ensure different teams can build beautiful user experiences, Modus currently supports the following devices and platforms:

## Currently Supported

### Web-based Software

Software that is built to be viewed on a web-browser on a desktop, tablet, and/or other mobile device. The content adapts to different screen sizes. Modus provides a responsive grid and design patterns that reflect best usability practices for all breakpoints.

The Modus Framework supports the following browsers:

- Chrome >= 60
- Firefox >= 60
- iOS >= 10
- Safari >= 10
- Android >= 6
- Internet Explorer 11

We use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to handle intended browser support via CSS prefixes, which uses [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) to manage these browser versions. Consult their documentation for how to integrate these tools into your projects.

### Desktop Software

A desktop application runs on a computer or device locally and is built to be installed in the environment of the deviceâ€™s operating system (i.e. Microsoft Windows).

### Mobile Applications

Modus supports native, hybrid, and web-based apps designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone or a tablet. Currently, we do not support watch patterns.

## Future Support

Modus currently does not provide support for software run on **in-cab hardware** and **mixed-reality** devices, such as the Microsoft HoloLens.
