## Usage Guidelines

The easiest way to start using our icons is to include the following code in the `<head>` of your page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@trimble-oss/modus-icons@{{< modus-icons-version >}}/dist/modus-solid/fonts/modus-icons.css">
```

Then use `<i class="modus-icon">icon_name</i>` with the name of the icon inside to insert it into your page.

## Design Guide

### Grid

<img src="/img/icon-guide-grid.png" width="345" height="140" loading="lazy" alt="" class="img-fluid float-right">
The standard icon size for the DRTrack icon set is 16px. The icons are built upon a base grid structure that includes guidelines for sizing of different shaped icons. These scale guidelines ensure each icon has the same visual weight so they all feel the same size, regardless of their overall shapes.

### Style

<img src="/img/icon-guide-style.png" width="345" height="205" loading="lazy" alt="" class="img-fluid float-right">
This icon set is built with a balanced combination of crisp geometric shapes, and subtle rounded corners to soften the edges and make them feel humanistic.
When possible, 1px gap is added to define shapes or add details.
